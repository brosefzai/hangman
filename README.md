### Hangman

###### Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

###### Aim

The aim of this project is to practice and demonstrate the python/bash/git skills I have picked up over the AiCore course so far.

What was new to me was creating a multi-functioned, multi-variable instance of a class that took in input. I have to be mindful (and thus learn more practically) to initialise, as well as with while True loops. Towards the end there were sections of the tutorial which took you down a wrong path, but at the same time solving them gives you a good boost of morale.


###### Instructions

Run the file. When it has been compiled, create a list of words titled word_list. Then, in the console, create an instance of the Hangman game and pass on your newly-created word list: game = Hangman(word_list). Finally, call the play_game function as follows: game.play_game(word_list).

###### File structure of the project

This game consists of one file, milestone_5.py. This file can be run in Terminal, or an IDE of your choice.
